# Advanced-Sales-Dashboard-with-Power-BI

## Description
The Northwind database is a sample database created by Microsoft for tutorials and testing purposes. 
It contains information about the business of Northwind Trades, a fictional company that sells various food products internationally. It includes information about orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, and employees.

For this project, I got the data in the form of several .csv files from [here](https://github.com/pawlodkowski/northwind_data_clean/tree/master/data).
